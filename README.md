# ZoomBotPro
This program was made to auto launch all my zoom classes for that day. I made this during covid when my school transitioned into the stay at home method.
Added, is also a google doc reader, designed to listen to the teacher and take notes, as well as import what she says into my program so my program could react to requests.
