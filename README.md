# ZoomBotPro
This program was made to auto-launch all my Zoom classes for that day. I made this during covid when my school transitioned into the stay-at-home method.
Included is a Google Doc reader, designed to listen to the teacher and take notes, as well as import what they say into my program so it may react to key words or requests.
